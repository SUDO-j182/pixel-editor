# pixel-editor

This was my third project and the first time I combined layout, style, and logic in a more advanced way. After completing my password generator, I wanted to create something more interactive that would challenge me to think in terms of user actions, state management, and DOM manipulation.

The result was a simple but functional pixel art editor built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a grid-based layout where users can select a color from a palette and click or drag across cells to draw. I added features over time, like line mode, export as PNG, and save/load functionality using local storage.

## Features

- Customizable grid-based drawing area
- Click or drag-to-paint interaction
- Color palette with active selection display
- Toggleable line drawing mode
- Clear grid and export to PNG
- Save and load artwork from local storage
- Minimal layout styled with custom fonts and grid logic

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- Canvas to PNG conversion (JS)

## Why This Project Matters

This project pushed me to take everything Iâ€™d learned in the first two builds and apply it in a more layered way. It taught me how to handle complex event logic, break down features into manageable steps, and write cleaner, more maintainable JavaScript. It also gave me the confidence to start thinking about how users interact with a tool, not just how it looks or functions internally.

## Future Improvements

- Add undo/redo functionality
- Include more advanced shape tools
- Improve mobile layout and touch support
- Add support for animation frame creation
- Refactor into modular components for better scalability
